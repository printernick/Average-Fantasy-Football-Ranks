# Average-Fantasy-Football-Ranks
A fun little project I made for fantasy football. The program takes the ranks of players and averages them out.

I really liked Sean Koerner's rankings for football players and wanted to use them for my fantasy football league. The issue was, however, he had rankings for players in standard scoring (0 points per reception) and full PPR (1 point per reception). The leagues I was playing in was half PPR (0.5 points per reception), so if I had used his rankings on either one, it would have been slightly inaccurate. I decided to create a Python program that compiles both rankings and averages them out to have a closer ranking to what my scoring would be.
